## Short Film MANI
- MANI - https://github.com/22nds/MANI, https://vimeo.com/427279482

## Soundscaping
- Environmental aspect - animals recorded, traffic sounds, sound polution
- Soundscapes in cities are so noisy

## Soundscape sounds

## Recording
Reference to **Nico, 1988** screenshot
- Audiorecorder (Zoom H4N Pro) or mobile phone or laptop microphone
- Headphones
- Windscreen - blocks wind sound
- Tripod
- Time and patience, gloves in the winter

## Editing
- Open source software - Audacity - https://www.audacityteam.org/
- Review samples from SuperDirt - clean, short, frequencies
- Review recording - dirty, long
- Make the sample
	- Select the sample from the whole track and copy it
	- Create a new track and paste the sample
	- Remove excess silence at the start and the end
	- Cut out the sample with Z for crossings
	- Loop the sample (Shift + Space)
- Normalize
	- Select the whole track
	- Effect > Normalize
- Remove noise: 
	- Select noisy part 
	- Effect > Noise Reduction and Get Noise profile
	- Select the whole track and apply Effect > Noise Reduction
- Add fade in / fade out if want it (Effects > Fade In / Effects > Fade Out)
- Play the sample again in a loop Shift + Space or Shift and Play button
- Edit the frequencies if needed
- Export as wav file (File > Export)

## Naming of files
- Create folders for similar sounds
- Number the files so that you always have a clear reference
- Add metadata to the sound file
- Open files folder in the Code editor to see available files

## Playing with TidalCycles
- Start SuperCollider 
- OPTIONALLY: Get the samples on GitHub repo for the workshop or use your own
- Add the sample files dierctory to boot file and restart Supercollider
- Open the Code editor

## TidalCycles Basics
- BPM / CPM
- Playing default samples
- Playing soundscaping samples
- Tidal effects and filters 

## Ideas
- Start with a clean sample, make a beat and then modify it

## Recording
- Record in SuperCollider IDE s.makeGui; or Server > Start recording
